# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

deployed: https://captainquickwit.github.io/UNC-Weather-Dashboard/

## Your Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
